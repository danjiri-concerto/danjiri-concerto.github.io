            <div class="rounded-box">
                <p>In the year 2XXX, a meteorite impact nearly wiped out the humans. Researchers engaged in space development were also affected, and it seemed that human space development had also come to an end. One hundred years later, however, humans have made a dramatic recovery and is enjoying peace. Scientists of the new era began to develop space exploration ships to make effective use of the legacy of space development left behind by their predecessors. Here, the space race was restarted, with each country's national prestige on the line.</p>
                <p>You are the astronauts entrusted with the space exploration ships of your countries. You need to build superior spacecraft faster than other countries and collect relics. If you are too lazy to build your own spacecraft, other countries will beat you to it. However, the short range exploration ship will not be able to find valuable relics. Which nation will be the first to utilize the recovered relics and enter an unprecedented realm? Let's seize the upper hand in the space development race of the new era with MINIMUM JOURNEY.</p>
